# Shield the Earth — How to Play

A quick guide to playing the mini-game. This version uses simple shapes (no character sprites yet) and runs in the browser.

---

## Goal
Protect Earth by rotating a magnetic shield arc to block incoming solar flares. Survive all waves (including the CME boss) with at least 1 Health to win.

---

## Controls
- Mouse / Touch: Move the pointer or finger anywhere on the screen to rotate the shield toward that angle.
- Keyboard (optional):
  - Left / Right Arrows: Rotate the shield slowly.
  - Space: Activate a temporary Full Shield (360°). Has a cooldown.
  - P or the Pause button: Pause/Resume the game.

Tip: Mouse/touch gives fastest aim; arrows help with fine adjustments.

---

## HUD & UI
- Health: Top-left. You start with 5.
- Score: Top-right. +10 for each blocked flare, +100 for defeating the boss.
- Wave: Top-center. Progresses from Wave 1 → 2 → 3 → CME Boss.
- Dialogue: Bottom-left. Sunny the Sun gives short lines when you block or get hit.
- Pause: Bottom-right button or press P.

## Gameplay Basics
1) Earth sits in the center; flares spawn from off-screen edges and travel toward Earth.
2) Rotate your shield to cover the incoming flare’s angle as it reaches the shield radius.
3) If covered, the flare is blocked (you gain points). If not, Earth loses Health.
4) Survive the current wave’s duration to advance. Defeat the CME boss to win.

---

## Scoring
- +10 per blocked regular flare.
- +100 for defeating the CME boss.

---

## Waves & Difficulty
- Wave 1 (Tutorial): Slower flares, wider shield arc.
- Wave 2: Faster flares, narrower arc, random angles.
- Wave 3: Faster and sometimes multiple flares at once.
- CME Boss: A larger, slower flare that takes multiple blocks to defeat.

---

## Power: Full Shield (Space)
- Grants a temporary 360° shield for a short duration.
- Enters cooldown when it ends. Watch cooldown text near the bottom of the screen.

---

## Tips
- Keep the shield slightly ahead of the nearest incoming flare.
- On mobile/touch, slide around the screen edges for smoother control.
- Use Full Shield sparingly—best saved for multiple flares or boss phases.

---

## Accessibility
- Keyboard-only play is supported (Left/Right + Space + P).
- High-contrast UI colors and minimal flashing effects.

---

## Running the Game
1) Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2) If the canvas looks blurry, try zooming to 100% in the browser.
3) To restart, refresh the page.

---

## Troubleshooting
- No movement? Ensure the browser tab is focused; move the mouse over the game.
- Touch not working? Try dragging on the screen; ensure no system gesture is interfering.
- Performance issues? Close other heavy tabs/apps; reduce window size.

Enjoy defending Earth!
